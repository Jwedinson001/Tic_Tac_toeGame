# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game project! This project is a simple yet visually appealing implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the Tic Tac Toe game. It includes the game board, buttons for restarting the game, and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- `css/styles.css`: This file contains the styles for the Tic Tac Toe game, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and hover effects to create a visually appealing interface.
- `js/script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code that implements the game logic, handling player moves, checking for win conditions, and updating the game board accordingly.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The game board will be displayed as a 3x3 grid.
3. Players take turns clicking on the empty squares to place their marks (X or O).
4. The game checks for a win condition after each move. If a player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win!
5. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
6. Click the "Restart" button to play again.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start playing the game.
